# MusicRipper
MusicRipper is an instrument based on youtube-dl, to download music.
Terminal based. 
The whole idea is to be able to have something to rip out music from youtube.
Using just a playlist url

# Features(TODO)
    #### Minimal update
        - Updates are very slow, there should be a way to do that more
            efficiently
        - editing outout file metadata to be a little bit more automatic.
        - Possibly add lyrics and artwork from somewhere(maybe thumbnail)
        - Will add more
